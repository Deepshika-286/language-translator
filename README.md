# Language Translator
This project is a language translator that translates text from German to English using a deep learning model. The model is built using TensorFlow (Keras) and trained on a dataset for language translation tasks.

## Overview
This translator uses a Sequential Neural Network model built with TensorFlow and Keras to translate German sentences into English.

## Features
- Translates German text into English.

- Built using machine learning techniques for natural language translation.

- Can be used with Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, or any other Python environment.

## Workflow
The project follows these steps:

- Data Collection: A dataset containing German and English sentence pairs is collected.

- Data Preprocessing: The data is preprocessed by splitting it into training and validation sets.

- Model Creation: A Sequential Neural Network model is created using TensorFlow (Keras).

- Model Training: The model is trained using the preprocessed data to learn the translation patterns between German and English.

- Translation Generation: The model generates an English translation given a German source sequence.

- Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics.

## Libraries Used
- TensorFlow (Keras): For building and training the neural network model.

- NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation in data preprocessing(encoding).

- Pickle: For any additional pre-processing (e.g., text tokenization, padding).

## Setup and Usage
This Python file can be run in Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, or any Python environment of your choice.

## Steps to Run:
- Clone the repository:

      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/language-translator.git
- Install the necessary libraries: You can install the required libraries using pip:

      pip install numpy tensorflow pickle
- Run the Python script: Simply run the Python file (translator.py) to start translating German text into English.

- Test the Translator: The model will prompt you for German text input, and it will provide the corresponding English translation.

## Model Evaluation
After training the model, its performance can be evaluated on a test dataset. The evaluation step provides u with taget sentences against predicted sentences.

## Contributions
Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, or add new features to enhance the translation capabilities. Contributions are welcome!

### Hope this helps! Happy learning!!
